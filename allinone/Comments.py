"""Comments are an extremely useful feature in most programming languages.
Everything you’ve written in your programs so far is Python code. As your
programs become longer and more complicated, you should add notes within
your programs that describe your overall approach to the problem you’re
solving. A comment allows you to write notes in English within your programs"""

#In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment

#The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work.

"""If you want to become a professional programmer or collaborate with 
other programmers, you should write meaningful comments. Today, most 
software is written collaboratively, whether by a group of employees at one 
company or a group of people working together on an open source project. 
Skilled programmers expect to see comments in code, so it’s best to start 
adding descriptive comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise 
comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as 
a new programmer."""
